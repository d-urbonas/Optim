Imagine you want to plan a road trip. You will want to go from point A to point B, however the things you pass through also matter. What we aimed to do was to source an accurate map data of roads within the US, then write code to find the best route from point A to B to C, etc. while being able to exclude going to locations that youâ€™ve already been to.
